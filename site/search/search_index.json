The fact that you've come this far shows that you're curious to learn more about me. So, please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Deepak. I'm a professional Hardware Engineer and a fearless experimenter, Formula 1 lover, Aviation enthusiast. No Facebook, No Instagram. I hate them. The only reason Twitter is there is to watch Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk figh and unlike Facebook and Instagram Twitter doesn't give up on me ;-) I read a decent number of books in a year and If I enjoy a book, I will read it at least five times. (Don't ask me for recommendations) All time Favorite books - The Martian, Project Hail Marry. To learn more about my Hardware Engineering expertise, check out my Work Experience What did I study? Back in 2013, just like many of you, I was unsure what to do after finishing my 12th grade, so I picked a pretty common option at the time. Engineering! I chose SRM University in Tamil Nadu to study Engineering. Why SRM University? Two reasons, One, nobody could rag/bully me at that university because I had my older brother as my senior to protect me (Hahah! Although I got ragged a couple of times) Two, I wanted to get away from my home. I chose Electrical and Electronics as my University course work because I watched my brother performing some enjoyable projects with certain components (Breadboard, LEDs, Capacitors, Resistors etc.) over the summer holidays when I was in 12th grade . I used to look at him and be inspired, so I began exploring. I fried a few (around 40) tiny bulbs (which happened to be LEDs) by immediately plugging them into wall outlets. Electrolytic capacitors and resistors were the most enjoyable. When I plugged them into an AC outlet, it used to be Diwali in my house (Seriously, don't attempt this at home!) and the MCB would trip (which is why I am still alive!). I'm not sure why, but when I plugged capacitor it behaved like a bomb and resistor used to give colorful fires after plugging into the socket. I did a few more experiments after that and got electrocuted a couple of times as well. The curiosity towards electricity grew, and when the opportunity presented, I chose Electrical Engineering, and a few months after starting my course, I looked up a few textbooks and figured out why my MCB was tripping. Let's get in touch No comments here. That would be too weird. This is too personal. Just reach me out using below handles.
