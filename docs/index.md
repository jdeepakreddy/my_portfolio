# About Me!

The fact that you've come this far shows that you're curious to learn more about me. So, please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Deepak. I'm a professional Hardware Engineer and a
fearless experimenter, Formula 1 lover, Aviation enthusiast. No Facebook, No Instagram. I hate them. The only reason Twitter is there is to watch Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk figh  and unlike Facebook and Instagram Twitter doesn't give up on me ;-) I read a decent number of books in a year and If I enjoy a book, I will read it at least five times. (Don't ask me for recommendations)

All time Favorite books - The Martian, Project Hail Marry.

# What did I study?

Back in 2013, just like many of you,  I was unsure what to do after finishing my 12th grade, so I picked a pretty common option at the time. Engineering! I chose **SRM University** in Tamil Nadu to study Engineering. Why SRM University? Two reasons, One, nobody could rag/bully me at that university because I had my older brother as my senior to protect me (Hahah! Although I got ragged a couple of times) Two, I wanted to get away from my home.

I chose **Electrical and Electronics** as my University course work because I watched my brother performing some enjoyable projects with certain components (Breadboard, LEDs, Capacitors, Resistors etc.) over the summer holidays when I was in 12th grade . I used to look at him and be inspired, so I began exploring. I fried a few (around 40) tiny bulbs (which happened to be LEDs) by immediately plugging them into wall outlets. Electrolytic capacitors and resistors were the most enjoyable. When I plugged them into an AC outlet, it used to be Diwali in my house (Seriously, don't attempt this at home!) and the MCB would trip (which is why I am still alive!). I'm not sure why, but when I plugged capacitor it behaved like a bomb and resistor used to give colorful fires after plugging into the socket. I did a few more experiments after that and got electrocuted a couple of times as well. The curiosity towards electricity grew, and when the opportunity presented, I chose Electrical Engineering, and a few months after starting my course, I looked up a few textbooks and figured out why my MCB was tripping.
