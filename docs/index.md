# Me in 30 seconds!

The fact that you're reading this shows that you're curious to learn more about me. So this is where I write all about myself, without feeling the need for it to be useful to you. And some day this site will be all that’s left of me, so I'm gonna keep updating this from time to time.

I am, a Hardware Engineer, a fearless experimenter, a Formula 1 lover, an Aviation enthusiast and a binge watcher. Deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts. The only reason Twitter is there is to watch Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk fight. Sometimes I'm in good shape and sometimes I'm not. Hey, gotta live you know?

I Love finding a different point of view.

My favorite books - The Martian, Project Hail Marry.
