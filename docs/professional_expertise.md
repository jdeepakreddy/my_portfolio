**Status** - Development <br>

Logicboard is a commercial off-the-shelf, easy to use System on Module (SoM) that focuses on medium-volume embedded projects. Customers can¬†benefit from the hardware, software, and service integration, which reduces complexity, time-to-market, risk, and costs. <br>

**Tasks**

- Schematic design of SoM with STM32MP1 Microprocessor, DDR3L SDRAM, eMMC Flash, PMIC and Board to Board Mezzanine connectors.
- Designed a compact high speed 42 x 42mm HDI PCB populating it with Microprocessor (18 x 18mm 448 pin BGA), DDR3L (96 pin BGA), eMMC Flash, PMIC, WiFi Module and Board to Board Mezzanine connectors.
- Designed carrier board with MIPI-DSI, HDMI, USB, SDMMC (eMMC Flash, Micro-SD), ethernet, SPI, I2C and UART/USART interfaces.
- Took the idea from concept to prototype stage.
- Board bring-up
- Working on developing custom Linux OS for the SoM.
